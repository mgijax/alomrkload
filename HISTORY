CHANGES: Changing default so we can get more info about what this load is doing
in particular what it is updating and deleting. This change came about when this
loaded deleted the gensat allele/marker associations because they were loaded 
with ALL_Marker_Assoc.status of 'Loaded' instead of 'Curated'. 
We shoule update alomrkload so it only deletes 'Loaded' alleles of type
gene trap alleles, not ALL 'Loaded' alleles.
1) alomrkload.config.default - set:
LOG_DEBUG=true - to log debug info the diag log
DBDEBUG='-f' - to log inline update sql to sql.log
